<h1>Hey, I'm Amanda!</h1>
<p>I'm in my fifth year, and just finished a co-op at <a href="http://upstatement.com">Upstatement.</a> I'm originally from Long Island and have mixed feelings about it. My favorite color is <span style="color:#cc0033">red.</span></p>
<p>Anyway, I'll just get to it. I've had a big crush on FiveThirtyEight's interactives over the past year and <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/clinton-trump-hip-hop-lyrics/">this recent one</a> is a favorite.</p>
